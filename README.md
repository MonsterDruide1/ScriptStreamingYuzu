# ScriptStreamingYuzu
This is a Discord-Bot that will automatically run scripts on an instance of Yuzu.

This project will not compile on other systems than my own at the moment, as it requires `SMO-Practice-Server` (https://github.com/MonsterDruide1/smo-practice-server) and `NintendoCompressions` (not published) as local dependencies. It also has some hardcoded path, and a specific build of Yuzu for using it.
